# Welcome to my Froggo setup :frog:

My personal configuration files for various applications and tools on EndeavorOS.

![Desktop Setup](./Image.jpg)

## Contents

This repository includes configuration files for:

- **Sway** - Wayland compositor with custom keybindings and auto-start applications
- **Waybar** - Status bar for Wayland
- **Wofi** - Application launcher

## Installation

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LostPieceUniverse/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
```

You can either copy the configuration files or create symlinks. Symlinks are recommended as they allow you to keep your configurations in sync with this repository.

### Option 1: Using Symlinks

```bash
ln -sf ~/dotfiles/sway ~/.config/sway
ln -sf ~/dotfiles/waybar ~/.config/waybar
ln -sf ~/dotfiles/wofi ~/.config/wofi
```

### Option 2: Copying Files

```bash
cp -r sway ~/.config/
cp -r waybar ~/.config/
cp -r wofi ~/.config/
```

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following packages installed:

```bash
sudo pacman -S sway waybar wofi fish alacritty swaylock swayidle grim brightnessctl
```

Additional dependencies for the Sway configuration because of autostart:
